To use the authentication client, you need to host at least one pool index
server and a torpydo node.

You can directly run the `torpydo_basic_pool_index_server.py` and the `torpydo_basic_nody.py`
in `examples`, the client is already configurated for the ip address of the pool index
given in example.
